Temperature Controlled AC - system is required to respond in time to a request\n\nAircraft engine control systems\n\n- Network or Remote Controlled ES\nDesigned to be reactive or non-reactive to its environment\n\nBut it is built using a specialized communication processor, memory and a number of network access interfaces (known as network ports)\n\n- Mobile ES\n\n\n**Our Focus**  \n**Hardware** --> **Software** --> Firmware\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-16-12-00-25.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-16-12-00-50.png)\n\nhardware in es:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-16-12-02-17.png)\n\nCourse Specifics \n\n- Office 121, GICT  \n\n- TA - Yagnik Bhavsar  yagnik.b@ahduni.edu.in  \n\nTextBook\nAVR microcontrollers and Embedded Systems using Assembly and **C**\nMuhammad Ali Maridi Sarmad Naimi Sepehr Naimi\n\n\n- AVR Microcontrollers\n\nATmega32 and C programming\n\nStudy Microcontrollers interfacing with major peripherals\n\nUnits\n- Intro\n- Microcontroller FUnda\n- AVR\n\n30% endsem\n\n25% midsem\n\n45% Lab\n\nRelative Grading","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\TUfeA5fXQdWxkUr8Tp7wD.html","relUrl":"notes\\TUfeA5fXQdWxkUr8Tp7wD.html"},{"doc":"Cookbook","title":"Cookbook","hpath":"cookbook","content":"\nA place for all code snippets and tutorials","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\FN0b6L3iOjIjBlxENq9HK.html","relUrl":"notes\\FN0b6L3iOjIjBlxENq9HK.html"},{"doc":"Dotfiles","title":"Dotfiles","hpath":"cookbook.dotfiles","content":"\n## Setting Up Dotfiles\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles\n","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\ebYO234YF3ZtL5tirTdka.html","relUrl":"notes\\ebYO234YF3ZtL5tirTdka.html"},{"doc":"Cheatsheet","title":"Cheatsheet","hpath":"cookbook.cheatsheet","content":"\nCollection of all commands that are handy\n","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\Ks7_9yMfvrBvvqQDSsWP_.html","relUrl":"notes\\Ks7_9yMfvrBvvqQDSsWP_.html"},{"doc":"SSH","title":"SSH","hpath":"cookbook.cheatsheet.ssh","content":"\n## Change Default port\n`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`  \n\n## Restart SSH service\n`sudo systemctl restart sshd` or `ssh`","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\GJqlqCYimsU8ltnk0sZy5.html","relUrl":"notes\\GJqlqCYimsU8ltnk0sZy5.html"},{"doc":"Markdown","title":"Markdown","hpath":"cookbook.cheatsheet.markdown","content":"\n## Cheatsheet\n\n","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\I_7Ri-aL097P-tMPDfzua.html","relUrl":"notes\\I_7Ri-aL097P-tMPDfzua.html"},{"doc":"Books","title":"Books","hpath":"books","content":"\n","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\F0J4dNKc378hoFywrnfUk.html","relUrl":"notes\\F0J4dNKc378hoFywrnfUk.html"},{"doc":"Coffee Can Investing","title":"Coffee Can Investing","hpath":"books.coffee-can-investing","content":"\n## Words I learned\n\nThis is {{page.created}}\n\n- paucity  \nscarcity of something\n\n\n- volition  \nindependence","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\2rnuNUnOTOuP8awSQxqHX.html","relUrl":"notes\\2rnuNUnOTOuP8awSQxqHX.html"},{"doc":"Bookmarks üîñ","title":"Bookmarks üîñ","hpath":"bookmarks","content":"\n","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\E3ZN6evbVKc4AHyR5zT4s.html","relUrl":"notes\\E3ZN6evbVKc4AHyR5zT4s.html"},{"doc":"About This Site","title":"About This Site","hpath":"about","content":"","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\nKA-jBV6v1hHNCJpP4m8Y.html","relUrl":"notes\\nKA-jBV6v1hHNCJpP4m8Y.html"},{"doc":"Terms and Services","title":"Terms and Services","hpath":"about.tos","content":"\n","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\qNLaLLZDI5JKleydHQk-7.html","relUrl":"notes\\qNLaLLZDI5JKleydHQk-7.html"},{"doc":"Philosophy","title":"Philosophy","hpath":"about.philosophy","content":"\n![[now]]","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\5dwozvOSAmoXalfi1wGPU.html","relUrl":"notes\\5dwozvOSAmoXalfi1wGPU.html"},{"doc":"Hey üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","title":"Hey üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","hpath":"about.me","content":"\n## What I do?\n\n## What I have done?\n\n## Primary Interests\n\n## Other Interests\n\n## What am I upto?\n\n","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\5IJTtM3c_alpPdADQswcM.html","relUrl":"notes\\5IJTtM3c_alpPdADQswcM.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://notes.samkitk.com/notes\\changelog.html","relUrl":"notes\\changelog.html"}]
