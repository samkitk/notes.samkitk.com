- Microprocessor - definition:
something that takes input - interacts with memory and then gives output

It is a programmable integrated device that has computing and decision making capabilities similar to taht of the central processing unit - CPU

What is system?

A watch, washing machine is a system

Embedded System

An embedded system is a system that has two properties   
- software embedded into hardware 
- which makes a system dedicated  (inc)

The one that has a dedicated purpose software embedded in a computer hardware

We will learn how to design these embedded systems

design an elevator system (nice)

ES classification
- Stand alone ES
Designed to perform a very specific task repetitively

Eg. ECG machines : non reactive to the environment condition

Eg. Biometric Attendance System

- Real Time ES

A real time embedded system usually monitors the environment where the ES is installed

Eg. Temperature Controlled AC - system is required to respond in time to a request

Aircraft engine control systems

- Network or Remote Controlled ES
Designed to be reactive or non-reactive to its environment

But it is built using a specialized communication processor, memory and a number of network access interfaces (known as network ports)

- Mobile ES
