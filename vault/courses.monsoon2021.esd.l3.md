### Selection Criteria for choosing a microcontroller

![](/assets/images/2021-08-20-11-25-28.png)

1. Effectively meeting computing needs
* 8 Bit vs 16 Bit vs 32 Bit controller
* Speed
* Power Consumption
* Packaging
    * Space
    * Assembling
    * Prototyping End Product
* RAM and ROM on chip
* No. of I/O pins
* No of timers 
* How frequent are updates 
* Cost per unit

2. Availability of Software Dev Tools
* Ease of development of a product around it
    * Key considerations of Availability of
        * Assemblers
        * Debugger
        * Code-efficient C-language compiler
        * Tech Support
        * In-house and Outside expertise 

3. Availability of Reliable Sources of uC
* Companies supplying this controller
* Are the companies reliable

CISC vs RISC Procesors

CISC | RISC
--- | ---
Complex Instruction Set Computing | Reduced Instruction Set Computing
Single instruction can execute several low lever ops (like load from memort, arithmentic ops, memory store) | B2
multi-step operations capability | single step
VLSI Advantages | 
- Less Transistors |
- Extra Space |

### AVR RISC

Advanced Virtual RISC
8 Bit Bus,
Harvard Architecture

AVR range = 8bit to 32 bit RISC MCU
Speed = 16 to 32 MIPS (million instructions per sec) and pin counts from 8 to 100 pins
Flash memories from 1K to 256K
