## Rocks

* Igneous Rocks
    - Made from lava ; Molten material is magma
    - The magma, as it comes up the surface - cools,settles and solidifies.
    Two types of igneous rocks  
    - Molten Magma came up through explosion = extrusive igneous rocks
    - If it solidifies on crust intrusive igneous rocks
